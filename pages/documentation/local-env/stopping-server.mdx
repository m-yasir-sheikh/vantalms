## How To Stop Framecast AI?

To stop Framecast AI, Simply pressing `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the server is running won't do the trick. In
order to fully stop the server you need to open up another terminal and run the following command:

```json filename="terminal" copy
npx supabase stop framecast-ai
```

This will stop the Supabase server and you will no longer be able to access the backend. Once you've done that, you
can move to the terminal hosting your `Localhost server` and press `Ctrl + C` to stop the server. This completely
stops every running service and now you won't be able to access the application.
